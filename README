XenServer Xen-4.0 patchqueue
============================

 This directory contains local patches against Xen 4.0 that are needed
 for the product builds.  The underlying repository, xen-4.0.hg, is a
 clone of upstream xen-4.0-testing.hg, which will be updated from time
 to time. 

 Some build changes from upstream, and from previous product trees:
 - The python tool chain (xm, xend, etc) is no longer built,
   except for the libxc bindings and pygrub;
 - The various security framework tools are no longer built;
 - Qemu-dm is now built from a separate repository;
 - Debian linux kernels are now built from a separate repository.

Order of patches
----------------

 The series file is broken up into sections.  Please put new patches 
 in the appropriate section, either at the end of the section or beside
 other patches that cover a similar area.  The overall order is:

 - backports from xen-4.0-testing (if any);
 - backports from xen-unstable;
 - patches that are intended to go upstream to unstable;
 - changes to makefiles and build systems;
 - libxc;
 - dom0 tools (xenstore, pygrub, hotplug &c);
 - HVM firmware (hvmloader, BIOS images);
 - xen;
 - xentrace.


Naming patches
--------------

 Please give your patch a name that describes what it does.

 If the patch is a fix for a Jira ticket, it's not necessary to put the
 CA- number in the file name, but you should put it in the commit
 message so that the Jira/Mercurial plugin will associate it with the
 ticket, and in the comment at the head of the patch.

 If the patch is intended to go upstream to unstable then
 please include a proposed changelog entry and Signed-off-by: line
 suitable for those trees at the head of the patch file.


Fixes to existing patches
-------------------------

 If you are making a fix to code that has a patch already in the queue, 
 please don't add a new "fix-feature-foo" patch; instead, update the 
 existing patch with the fix. 

 One exception: if you're temporarily disabling a feature, it's OK 
 to add a "disable-feature-foo" patch, since that will usually be less
 work than removing the original feature from the queue.  Please 
 put such patches immediately after the patch they disable so it's 
 clear what's going on.


Back-porting from xen-unstable or xen-4.0-testing
-------------------------------------------------

 The primary path for patches to come from xen-unstable is that they 
 will be included in the underlying xen-4.0.hg tree once they are in 
 xen-4.0-testing.  However, there will be some patches which are 
 suitable for the product that are not suitable for the 4.0-testing
 tree, and towards a release we may want to cherry-pick from 4.0-testing
 instead of updating the underlying 4.0 tree.  When pulling such patches
 into this queue, please:
 - put them in the correct section of the series file, in the
   right order relative to other patches from the same tree; and
 - stick to the naming scheme.  A correctly named patch can be 
   generated with the following command:
   
   hg export -o <path to repo>/'%b-%R.%h' <revision number>
